# Linux Day 2025 - Git Talk Presentation

This repository hosts the slides of my talk for **Linux Day 2025** in Turin, created with [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and enhanced with [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams.

The slides cover essential Git concepts, workflows, and real-world scenarios.

You can view the presentation online here: [Git slides - on GitHub Pages](https://gioisco.github.io/linux-day-2025-git-talk/git-come-non-l'avete-mai-visto-cdn.html)

## Known Issue

There is a known bug with Mermaid in this presentation:

- **Git graphs sometimes fail to render** on initial page load.
- **Workaround:** Reload the page to correctly render the graphs.

This issue is related to the way Mermaid diagrams are initialized in combination with Reveal.js slide transitions.
